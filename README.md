SnapRoulette
============

##About

So, you know Snapchat & Chatroulette? SnapRoulette is those 2 combined!

SnapRoulette allows you to snap pics and send them off to completely random people! At the same time, you will be able to view completely random pics that other people have posted.

Use at your own risk.

Any brave souls who are willing to take a chance at random pictures or want to share somethings with others.  You could get a picture that is horrifying, funny, interesting, thought provoking, anything!

Pictures randomly send to people all over the world who has the app, and you can see things that happen possibly in the other side.  You won't know what you'll see.  All images go to the same server and we disperse them out.  The app is compatible with both iOS and Android.

**Use at your own risk.**
